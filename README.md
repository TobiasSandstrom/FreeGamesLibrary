# FreeGamesLibrary
A library and catalog of free-to-play games.
The first project I worked on in my programming career was a Blazor Server-Side application utilizing the MudBlazor UI library and the Fluxor state management pattern. In this project, I aim to further practice and refine my skills with these frameworks and techniques.

### The initial ideas
Pages:
1. Home/Start Page
    - The landing page for the application, showcasing a summary of the catalog.
2. Browse Page
   - Allows users to browse games by category, such as genres or platforms.
3. Game Details Page
    - Provides detailed information about a specific game, including images, descriptions, and external links.

Features:
- Navbar (Sidebar):
    - Provides easy navigation to the Home, Browse, and Randomize Game.
    - The "Randomize Game" button, will select a random free game and directs the user to that game's page.
- Coming Soon (Planned Feature):

    - A "Coming Soon" API call will be implemented to display upcoming free games.
    - Placement is undecidedâ€”this feature may appear on the Home page or have its own dedicated page.
